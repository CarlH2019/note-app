You can create,update,and delete your own notes on this fluid user interface! 

Built using ReactJS, it starts with a homepage that includes a list of all the notes that exist in the application. It includes a note detail page that shows a user the full details of a single note, a button to tag your note and when this button is clicked, it opens a form that allows users to enter custom tags. Submitting the form adds the tag to the note. It also includes error handling with flash notifications that alert the user when validation errors happen. Unfortunetely at this time, there are no user validations, so anyone can edit, update, and destroy. Please try it out and feel free to delete your note right after. 





By using a pre-built Note API, I first set up my back-end @ https://note-api-carl-hofstrom.herokuapp.com/notes
Then I set up my front-end using https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
Then I added code accordingly.
