You can create,update,and delete your own notes on this fluid user interface! 

Built using ReactJS, it starts with a homepage that includes a list of all the notes that exist in the application. It includes a note detail page that shows a user the full details of a single note, lets only that user edit,update,and delete the note via a form. It also includes a button to tag your note and when this button is clicked, it opens a form that allows users to enter custom tags. Submitting the form adds the tag to the note. You can also toggle between different states inside the application. It also includes error handling with flash notifications that alert the user when validation errors happen. 





By using a pre-built Note API, I first set up my back-end @ https://note-api-carl-hofstrom.herokuapp.com/notes
Then I set up my front-end using https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
